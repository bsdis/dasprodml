A reader and a writer for the prodml standard.

Currently in alpha stage of development.

This library is meant to be an implementation for the prodml standard for distributed accoustic data (DAS). The standard is defined by energistics and may be downloaded here : http://www.energistics.org/production/prodml-standards/current-standards

The library is mostly a wrapper around 2 dependency libraries generateDS and python-opc. Both libraries may be updated or changed since neither have so much activity any longer. In short, this library is subject to changes - hence its alpha phase label.
